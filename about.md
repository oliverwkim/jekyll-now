![Oliver Kim.](/images/square.jpg "Oliver Kim")

I am a PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley. I graduated from Harvard College in 2016, and worked at the New York Fed from 2016-18.

Watch this space for my occasional musings on current events, economic history, development, and political economy. If my (current) research interests have a theme, it's understanding what policies and institutions actually _work_ in lifting people out of poverty. I am ethnically Korean, but was born in Hong Kong, and raised in Hong Kong and Singapore, which understandably makes East Asian experience a focus.

You can check out my [GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5661522-oliver-kim) for my thoughts on what I've been reading lately, some of it economics, most of it not. I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oliverwkim), but make it a rule not to post. In my salad days I wrote a column and drew cartoons for [_The Harvard Crimson_](https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1209815/Oliver_W._Kim/), which I hope do not reflect too poorly on me now.

### Where does the W come from?

The W in my name stands for "Wyatt", like the famous lawman from the Gunfight at the OK Corral (which, coincidentally, form my other two initials). I recently learned that two movies about Wyatt Earp came out in the year before my birth. The first, 1993's _Tombstone_, starred Kurt Russell as Earp. It got decent reviews and made $56 million on a $25 million budget. The second, 1994's _Wyatt Earp_, starred Kevin Costner, who was nominated by the Razzies for Worst Actor that year. It made only $25 million on a $63 million budget. 

I hope my parents saw the first one.
