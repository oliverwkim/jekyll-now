Joe Studwell calls this the "triumph of the historians".



There's a recent genre of articles, by an older generation of development economists, that almost wants to claim the RCT-less success of East Asia for themselves. These claims deserve a dose of humility.

Bill Easterly's libertarian-flavored framework has very little
