Lant Pritchett has a recent article out about RCTs.

He poses a rhetorical question: Did South Korea RCT its way out of poverty?

Pritchett has a point, of course. But I think his question, with its focus on the RCTs' failures, suffers from a selective blindness. I'll take his question even further. Has the work of economists _ever_ mattered for the escape of poor countries out of poverty?

## The Triumph of the Historians

I'll focus on East Asia, the region Pritchett named, the corner of the world that I know best, and really the only place that has managed to grow its way out of poverty in the last century. To spare you the suspense, the answer to my question is yes---but a qualified yes, and not an answer that I think would flatter Pritchett's brand of development economics.

When Paul Samuelson, they picked Ghana.

Of the crop of foreign advisors to East Asia, two figures stand out.

The first is Wolf Ladejinsky, who advised land reforms in Japan, Taiwan, South Vietnam, and India. Ladejinsky who had grown up in Ukraine and fled the Soviets as a boy, was. During the Occupation of Japan, he gave key technical advice to MacArthur, including advocating for land _redistribution_ as opposed to just rent reduction.

A similar figure is Albert Winsemius, a Dutch UN advisor who was dispatched to Singapore in 1960. 

It would be historical malpractice to call either Ladejinsky or Winsemius a proto-randomista. But the spirit of their work---calling for the blatant violation of property rights, and the active intervention of government in industry---runs very much against neoclassical orthodoxy. If East Asia got rich because of economists, the economics they were preaching was heretical to the 

Indeed, the intellectual influences

Joe Studwell calls this the "triumph of the historians".


It's also important to remember that for every Ladejinsky and Winsemius, there was a Walt Rostow or a gang of Berkeley Boys. 




There's a recent genre of articles, by an older generation of development economists, that almost wants to claim the RCT-less success of East Asia for themselves. These claims deserve a dose of humility.

Bill Easterly's libertarian-flavored framework has very little
