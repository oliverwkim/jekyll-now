Hello. I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley, starting in 2018. I did my undergrad at Harvard College, graduating in 2016, and worked for two years at the New York Fed.

Watch this space for my occasional musings on current events, economic history, development, and political economy. If my (current) research interests have a theme, it's understanding what policies and institutions actually _work_ in lifting people out of poverty.

You can also check out my [GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5661522-oliver-kim) for my thoughts on what I've been reading lately. I have a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/https://twitter.com/oliverwkim), but make it a rule not to post. In my salad days I wrote a column and drew cartoons for [_The Harvard Crimson_](https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1209815/Oliver_W._Kim/), which I hope do not reflect too poorly on me now.

##What does the W stand for?
