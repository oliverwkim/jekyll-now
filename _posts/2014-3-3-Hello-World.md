Hello. I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley, starting in 2018. I did my undergrad at Harvard College, graduating in 2016, and worked for two years at the New York Fed.

Watch this space for my occasional musings on current events, economic history, development, and political economy. You can also check out my [GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5661522-oliver-kim) for my thoughts on what I've been reading lately. I have a [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/https://twitter.com/oliverwkim), but make it a rule not to post. In my salad days I wrote a column and drew cartoons for [_The Harvard Crimson_](https://www.thecrimson.com/writer/1209815/Oliver_W._Kim/).
