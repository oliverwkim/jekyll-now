title: Hirschman's Strategy
---

Over the next few weeks, I'll be blogging through Albert Hirschman's _Strategy of Economic Development_, an early classic of the field. Hirschman was one of the first development economists, and a fascinating historical figure in his own right. Malcolm Gladwell wrote a rather lovely _New Yorker_ profile on his life (and Jeremy Adelman has an excellent biography, if your interest is piqued), so I will not dwell on it here. Suffice it to say that Hirschman was an anti-Nazi activist in Weimar Germany; volunteer for the Spanish Republicans; and number two for an underground that smuggled thousands of Jews (including Hannah Arendt and Marc Chagall) out of Occupied France—--all before he turned 25!

Because of his tumultuous early life, Hirschman was basically disconnected from the mainstream of American economics for the first part of his academic career. Unusually for that era, he spent extensive time in the field, including several years as a sort of freelance consultant in Bogotá, Colombia. The result was a wry literary style that emphasized in-person observation, and an allergy to the sweeping "Big Push" models fashionable at the time. (As Chris Blattman writes, modern randomistas could be counted among Hirschman's intellectual heirs.)

*The Strategy of Economic Development*, widely regarded as Hirschman's first major work, is now out of print. I hope by blogging about it; and also, more selfishly, to force myself to keep my own notes, and finish the damn thing.
